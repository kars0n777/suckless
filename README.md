**These are my suckless builds. I've only modified dwm and slstatus, but these are mainly so I can pull them down from github** 

- These are my suckless builds for dmenu, dwm, slstatus and st
- I am new to suckless software so any help would be appreciated
- My new dwm build that I'm trying to get alpha working with is in <https://github.com/kars0n777/dwm-alpha>
    - I use picom as my compositor, and I'll upload some logs later
