# my dwm 6.3 config

**differences from my 6.2 config**
    - no systray
    - less patches (for compatability) 
    - patches have own dir

* i am still using my 6.2 config as of right now so this is a work in progress

* i still want my bar to have alpha but i know might not be possible due to other patches and the original patch made for 6.1

* if you have any questions, comments let me know
