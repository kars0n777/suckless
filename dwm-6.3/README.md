# my dwm 6.3 config

### differences
* no systray
* less patches
* no scratchpads
* updated to dwm 6.3 (obviously)
    * and the patches i used all worked and only 1 needing to be manually patched

### features
* dracula black theme (goes nice with a dark background)
* can't see unused tags 

### things i want to add
* one tagset for all monitors patch (it seems to not compile with the attach below patch)
* manual scratchpad patch
